\hypertarget{firstnews}{\heading{Hurricane Jim}{6pt}}
Members Jim Craveiro (technicalfox), and Ben Summerton (bsummerton) ran\verb|^|H\verb|^|H\verb|^|H splashed into trouble February 15th, as their heating unit exploded into a dramatic ad-hoc sauna. Jim was in the room when the event occurred, and quickly summoned help from fellow CSH'ers, who were delighted to record videos and take pictures while watching Jim struggle to save his possessions. One member even managed to post a short clip to Facebook, with a spectacular geiser spewing forth from the poor lad's room. This editor was highly amused.

Jim was not the only one affected; several rooms around the event epicenter have been water damaged. FMS has been ripping out some of the underlying structure to prevent mold and other materials from harming the occupants. Please consider offering up a spare couch or spare room for their salvaged belongings.

One anonymized member thought that their content might not fit the bill for Segfault:

\hypertarget{fourthnews}{\heading{An Open Source Tip Of The Day}{6pt}} 

Emacs may not the most popular editor on floor, but more than just this editor use it for their text comprehension and editing.

\begin{quote}
Ediff is an easy way to compare two versions of a file. The most common way I activate it is with M-x ediff-buffers. Emacs highlights the differing regions in the buffers and pops up a new window in which you can enter additional commands. For example, n and p move among differing regions in the buffers. For each region, you can copy the first (or second) buffer's version to the other buffer with a and b, respectively. You can even edit either buffer while Ediff is active. Then you can switch back to the Ediff window and press ! to recompute the diff. Being able to view the differences between two files interactively— while editing those files— can be really useful.
