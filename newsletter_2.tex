Soon, the Evaluations Director will need to form a Selections committee to choose which of next years incoming Freshman make the cut. Current Director Tal Cohen (tcohen) is currently looking people interested, and will give more information about how to get on the committee.

The selections committee has a long tradition, dating back to the beginning of the '83 school year, where high demand to join the Computer Science House caused all available spots on floor to be filled. At the time, floor was a very small tight knit community, and the growth had degraded the previous atmosphere on floor. To solve this, the infamous \textit{Packets}, or evaluation sheets as they were known, were introduced.

On Easter 2003, after the EH Easter egg hunt, we decided we weren't finished for the day. The next plan was to keep them from getting onto their floor. We thought that if we put duct tape on the elevator door, they wouldn't be able to get off on their floor.
To test this theory, we put Heise in an elevator and put duct tape on the door as soon as he left. When he came back to floor 3, we found out that not only could he not get off the elevator, but he couldn't make the elevator go to any other floors either. He was trapped in the elevator until we removed the duct tape.

So here's what we did: When EH's weekly house meeting started, we sent Tom to the first floor to monitor it. Me, Drew, and Heise went up to EH and hid in their elevator lounge. The plan was for Tom to call Drew on his cell phone when EH left the meeting so that we could put duct tape on the elevator doors and run away. To rub it in even more we put a sign on the inside of the one working elevator on each side of the door that read "engineer your way out of this."

We were almost foiled at first when an EH member (apparently EH sucks because a good portion of their floor don't go to house meetings) walked into the elevator lounge. We ran down their hall and down the five floors of stairs back to CSH. We waited a few minutes and went back up, this time nobody was there. A few minutes later Tom called and we quickly put duct tape on the door. As soon as we heard someone say "what the fuck!?" from inside the elevator we ran away - CSH: 2, EH: 0
