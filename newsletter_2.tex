\begin{quote}
 * The Executive Board would like to remind all of CSH that sentient
   glow clouds do not exist, and any mention of such clouds will result
   in mandatory psychotherapy.
   
 * Despite the fact that no one has seen ARG, or the ARG Room in 15 years,
   ARG will be meeting this Wednesday in the ARG Room.
   
 * During an attempt to increase airflow efficiency in the server room,
   all of the air contained therein was accidentally evacuated into
   space.  Several RTPs are missing.

Welcome to Night Vale is a twice-monthly podcast in the style of community updates of a dessert town, featuring local weather, news, announcements from the Sheriff's Secret Police, and more. In short, it's a zaney, hilarious, telepromted podcast about a scifi-esque town. Member Russ Harmon (russ) has taken to transposing recent meetings to the podcast format. 

This editor would like to remind members on behalf of the Secret Executive Board Police, that the smoke billowing from the Server Room is not to be reported. In fact, there is no server room, the thought should be removed from your memory. Any dissidents should be immediately reported to the Secret Exectutive Board Police.
