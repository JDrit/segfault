\textbf{Googlers Everywhere}

Technically active, semi-alumnus, but really demigod member Russ Harmon (russ) dropped by floor this week as part of a Google recruiting drive. Russ's efforts to educate and push floor members has earned him quite the reputation among active members and alumni alike. Joining him at Google will be current History director Josh McSavaney (mcsaucy), and co-op'ing at Google this semester will be member Drew Gottlieb (dag10).

\textbf{Call to Pay Dues}

If you have not payed dues this semester, please do so by contacting current Financial directory Derek Gonyeo (dgonyeo). If dues are not paid, you will not be able to vote in elections, house votes, or any other director meeting. \textbf{If you cannot pay dues for financial reasons or otherwise, please let the financial directory know.} CSH is dedicated to using it's funds for its members.

\textbf{Selections Committee Coming Up}

Evaluations Director Tal Cohen (tcohen) would like to remind active members that the time for selections committee is nearing. As mentioned in previous articles, the selections committee is in charge of evaluating new applications to CSH, and will be working with Housing to sort applicants.

\hypertarget{firstnews}{\heading{Imagine RIT}{6pt}}

Officially, Imagine RIT is an annual event hosted on campus that is open to the public, and generally attracts people to see student works. An excerpt from RIT's website says:

\begin{quote}
Imagine RIT is designed to demonstrate what can be accomplished when, as RIT President Bill Destler likes to say, “the right and left brain collide.” Visitors have witnessed a robot that serves hot dogs, a concrete canoe that floats and dozens of musical and theatrical performances. Children have made freeze-dried ice cream, test driven Segways and jumped around in a bounce house.
\end{quote}

This kind of human interaction has traditionally let students garner some attention for their neat projects, and has inspired many to seek funding or academic support. CSH has participated for several years, and often gathers quite the crowd at our unique booths. A call submissions to Imagine RIT has been out for a while, and if you'd like to have your project featured in the festival, talk to the Research \& Development Director Travis Whitaker (tmobile).

\hypertarget{secondnews}{\heading{ret = brk()}{6pt}} 

This editor, like many editors previous, would like some Member content for the weekly publication. The content genre isn't so important, so long as the quality is at least worth a cursory readover. In particular this editor would appreciate posts regarding user environments, (programming) language preferences, philophical arguments regarding technology, and as an aside, haikus. To have at least one "real-world" technically relevant section per publication would be ideal.

Floor Directors, this editor would particularly like your input for upcoming events that may or may not have made it to Webnews. Votes that have occurred are not tracked through any central system, making it difficult to find relevant outcomes.

Responses, comments, complaints, or corrections should go to segfault@csh.rit.edu.
\textit{Particularly radical submissions may be awarded a mysterious token of the value \$2.56, from the bank of Segfault}
