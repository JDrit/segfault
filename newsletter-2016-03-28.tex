\hypertarget{firstnews}{\heading{Sorting Algorithms everyone should know}{6pt}}

You thought you knew about all the cool sorting algorithms that you learned in your CS1 classes, but
I am here to tell you that you do not even know the real sorting algorithms that are used throughout
industry. Here we will be going over the most closely guarded sorting algorithms that have ever been
invented. The reason you have never heard about any of these is that it is the media and publishers
trying to hide the truth from you so that they can keep all the cool sorting to themselves. Don't
let them keep you down man!
\\
\\
\textbf{Sleep Sort}

This algorithm has its basics in Number theory. It works by creating a thread per element in your
list to sort. Once you do that, tell each thread to sleep equal to the value of the element you gave
it. Now all the threads will wake up in sorted order! Congratulations are in order, you now just
sorted it all in O(n) time (yes there is a constant C for the sleep time but we are theorists so we
are allowed to remove constants :P).
\\
\\
\textbf{Fail Sort}

This is another cool algorithm that can return a sorted list on O(n) time. It works by generating a
permutation of the input and checking that new list. If the new list is sorted, return it. Otherwise
execute 1 / 0 and segfault. This will guarantee that your program will always return sorted data.
\\
\\
\textbf{Bogo Sort}

Ever wanted a really amazing sorting algorithm that does almost no work a lot? Then look no further
than bogo sorting. This involves a very complex process in which you generate a random permutation
of the input the list and see if it is sorted. If it is, then you are done. Otherwise try again. See
how simple that was? Now you too can implement it in all of your code and be a super cool hacker
bro.
\\
\\
\textbf{Quantum Bogo Sort}

Now this algorithm is super cool and realizes on quantum dimensional physics. You also have to
believe in the existence of an unlimited parallel universes. This algorithm is based on the previous
algorithm. The first step is to run bogo sort. Now due to the proof of infinite parallel universes,
there must be at least one universe in which the list is sorted. Jump to that universe and you have
now sorted the list in O(1) time! How amazing is that!
\\
\\
\textbf{Miracle Sort}

This algorithm is based on using solar radiation to modify the order of the input data. The
algorithm puts the input data into memory and then waits for solar radiation to flip the data in
memory. Eventually the memory will be hit by enough alpha particles that it will result in a sorted
list. The running time of this algorithm has yet to be determined. This requires that you do not use
ECC-memory since that will dampen / elongate the time needed to do the full sort algorithm.
