\textbf{Notable Upcoming Events:}
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=0.2cm]
\item \textbf{Potter Networking} Nov. 12, 7pm \\
	Come learn about networking and stop being a stupid CS major
	in which you think the network is always reliable. 
\\
\item \textbf{Nethack Binge} Nov. 13, 9pm \\
	Nethack is a single-player roguelike video game originally

	me Potter in the game :)
\\
\item \textbf{Insights} Nov. 14 - Nov. 15 \\
	Perceptive RIT students will be staying on-floor to learn about
	CSH and RIT at large. There will be plenty of activities planned
	all weekend long that everyone should help with.
\\  
\item \textbf{Open House} Nov. 14, 11am \\
	Be prepared to be waken up and help show off floor to all the 
	perspective students.

\hypertarget{firstnews}{\heading{Computer Scientist of the Week: 
	Leslie Lamport}{6pt}}
	
	Leslie Lamport, born in 1971, is a computer scientist who is known
	for his major contributions to the field of distributed systems and
	for being an initial contributor to Latex. He was awarded the Turning
	Award in 2013 for his work in imposing clear, well-defined coherence
	on  the seemingly chaotic behavior of distributed computing systems. 
	Lamport currently works at Microsoft Research in California.\\
	\\
	Some of his most famous papers are:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Time, Clocks, and the Ordering of Events in a 
	Distributed System:} A major issue in distributed computing is 
	determining the order of in which events take place.
	How do you know the order of database updates when they were 
	submitted to different machine, potentially from different 
	continents. This paper goes into the concept of logical clocks
	to provide a global ordering of events in a system.
	\\
	\item \textbf{The Byzantine Generals' Problem:} This paper deals
	with the concept of fault tolerance in distributed systems. The
	objective of Byzantine fault tolerance is to be able to defend 
	against Byzantine failures, in which components of a system fail
	with symptoms that prevent some components of the system from 
	reaching agreement among themselves, where such agreement is needed
	for the correct operation of the system. This paper then goes on
	to show what is necessary for a system to keep working under these
	conditions.
	\\
	\item \textbf{The Part-Time Parliament:}
	This paper introduced the idea of the Paxos consistency protocol, 
	which has formed the based for most major systems out there. While
	many criticize this paper for being too abstract it still was
	revolutionary for its time and is still considered a major development
	in the field of distributed systems.
	\end{itemize}
