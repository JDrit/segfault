\hypertarget{firstnews}{\heading{Tips for Being a Social Member \\ by Liam Middlebrook}{6pt}}
 
\textbf{Definitions} \\
\textbf{Trumper:} \textit{Noun} \\
A member who values technical skill over social skill. Trumpers have been
known to claim "but if we're \textbf{Computer} Science House, shouldn't members
understand computers?"

\textbf{Meme:} \textit{Noun} \\
A joke gifted to us by 4chan or Reddit that only the cool kids will get.
Anyone who is annoyed by memes is a Trumper and should be ignored.

\textbf{10 Weeks:} \\
Avoid going to too many technical seminars, Braden and Meghan might say that
the constitution requires you to go to two, don't listen to them you don't want
to be made fun of and called a Trumper. You should probably attend at least one,
but don't worry you can always go to a seminar by someone like Sneha or Oliver
who will just give you free attendance and you can just browse the net for dank
memes.

Make sure to go to \textbf{every} social event that is hosted. If you miss more than
three of these you'll be shunned for being a Trumper. If you can try to host
your own social event with the help of our fabulous Social Director, Trumpers
would never host a social event so this will help you for 10 weeks.

As long as you don't try to do any projects before 10 weeks you should be fine.
People who do projects before 10 weeks are automatically classified as Trumpers
and will not be allowed to social events.

\textbf{Life on Floor} \\
Make sure to avoid the following rooms, these are known Trumper sighting
locations
\begin{itemize}
\item Project Room 
\item Research Room
\item Server Room 
\item NRH 3063 
\end{itemize}
If you find yourself stuck in one of these rooms immediately start listing off
all of the memes you have memorized and slowly back out, never turning your back
from a Trumper.

\textbf{Final Comments} \\
At the end of the day it's us versus them. If you think someone you know is
becoming technical invite them over to the Lounge to watch some /r/youtubehaiku
until 4am, it's the most effective way to stop people from doing projects.
