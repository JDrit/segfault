\hypertarget{firstnews}{\heading{Secret Santa Round Up}{6pt}} 

Last night was the Computer Science House Holiday Dinner and Secret Santa. A big
thanks to Colin O’Neill for running such entertaining events! Here are some of 
Segfault’s favorite gifts from last night. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Marc Billow} received a beautifully written letter from slack-will
telling him that he knows about Marc's secret lust for JD. The letter provided 
tools to seduce Paul Ugolini instead, kinky. 

\item \textbf{Travis Whitaker} and \textbf{Luke Shadler} both received the same 
poster of Travis crying while Monica Rizzo and Luke both stand together in a photo
the shape of a heart. 

\item A framed photo of \textbf{Nick Mosher} and \textbf{George Morgan} holding
themselves passionately in field of flowers, notice the hand action going on there.

\item \textbf{Sheckle} received more of a mission than a present. She removed 
bottles of ketchup from 5 different boxes with the goal of not covering herself
in ketchup.  

\item \textbf{Brandon Chu} got a care package from home, reminding him of what he
is missing. Oh man that MSG looks appetizing!

\end{enumerate}

In order for me to describe what containers are, let's first establish what
virtual machines are, and why they exist. Before any of this container or VM
stuff came about, you would just run applications straight on your server. 
If Sally wanted PHP 5.6 on the server to run her stuff, and Bob wanted PHP 5.1
to run something else, they'd either need to complicate their server by having multiple versions of PHP available, or Bob would need to run his stuff on a different machine.

This is annoying, and it's a problem that VMs can solve. Instead of getting a
whole new computer to run his shitty little website, we have software built to
help you put a secondary OS on the same machine through lies. The new OS
\textit{thinks} it's on its own hardware, but all of the hardware bits that
it is twiddling are secretly just emulated by the original OS. The virtual
machine's kernel goes to send a packet to the network interface? Nah, it's 
just a thing in software that goes to the host OS. The kernel tries to write a
file? More lies. That's not a real hard drive, but just a file on the host OS. 
Now Sally can run her new and shiny PHP app, and Bob can run his old and shitty
PHP app, and each of them get their own web server with only the version of PHP
that they want.

Many companies have built fortunes using lies - err, VMs - to be able to give
each little service / application its own machine. One annoying thing about
this strategy though is it can take a significant amount of work to set up a
VM. If you've ever installed Linux, imagine going through that process manually
for each set of things you want to run. There is tooling around doing this
automagically for you, but if you're not paying Amazon you'll be setting that
up yourself.

In our hypothetical scenario where Bob insists on using a version of PHP from
2005 for some god awful reason, what if we could streamline the process by
using significantly less lies? Ultimately the end goal is just having multiple
web servers with different versions of PHP running on the same machine. Do we
really need to emulate network cards, CPUs, hard drives, and more for each web
server? What if we could only lie about the versions of PHP available on the
system, and let the different web servers use the real block devices and memory
space on the host? Containers are, in a sense, exactly that. Containers are kinda
like VMs in that they're also built with the goal of lying to parts of your computer,
but they aim to be easier to use/setup by lying about significantly less.
