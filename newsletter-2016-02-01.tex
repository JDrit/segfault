Amendments}{6pt}}
\begin{quote}

\textbf{\textit{author: \censor{mdumont}}}
\end{quote}

As any Illuminati member worth their salt will tell you, the key to grabbing 
power is slowly rewriting the rules over time while no one is keeping track. 
The first step is to make sure you have a plan. Come up with a list of things 
to accomplish in your rewrites. This might take several quarters (or years), 
so you must have direction at the beginning.  \\
\\
The next thing is to find items legitimately wrong with the constitution. It is important to demonstrate that you are fixing problems with the existing 
document so that every once in a while you can slip your own changes in. 
You need to overload your subjects with information. If you pass five 
amendments at once people will take less time looking over them because there
is so much to look at. This will help you sneak your less acceptable amendments
through the process with less scrutiny. \\
\\
The thing you have to remember is that you are doing this because you believe
your solution is correct and that everyone else is wrong. If you are caught 
once then your whole plan will unravel because people will be on the lookout for rogue changes. One tip for sneaking changes through the process is to change words
and parts of grammar in the clauses incrementally. Just sneak a few changes in 
at a time so that they aren't noticed immediately until the whole clause has 
been rewritten. This ensures that your rise to power will go entirely 
unnoticed… just as it should.

\textbf{Make sure the masses:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Think they are happy} — Bonus points for holding regular 
social events to keep your masses entertained and distracted.

\item \textbf{Think they are self-governing} — Hold sham elections; 
bonus points if your last-minute write-in candidates suddenly win, 
even though none of the voters have even really heard of your candidate. 
Double bonus points if this happens and no one suspects anything. 
Triple bonus points if you write multiple secret societies into your
organization's constitution that elect their own members to your governing
body regardless of any majority vote.

\item \textbf{Have a secret agenda}, and make sure to subtly bring people 
over to your point of view, and make people do what you want. Bonus points: 
Convince them that it was their idea to begin with.

\item \textbf{Eliminate resistance to your rule.} Bonus points: Have a 
secret judicial process.

\item \textbf{Control the media.} Bonus points: Have your own weekly newspaper. 
Double bonus points: Have your own website. Triple bonus points: Have your 
own quarterly newspaper. Quadruple bonus points: Start your own computer 
network. Entice users onto it with promises of higher speeds, but then use 
the network to spy on their every action, and censor any attempts to end 
your reign of power. Quintuple bonus points: Give your underlings shell 
access, email accounts, and webspace on your own servers to ensure easier
control and censure.
