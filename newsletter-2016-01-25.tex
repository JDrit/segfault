\textbf{\textit{author: \censor{adinardi}}}
\end{quote}

No one can ever know the real, true plans of the Illuminati. They are veiled 
in secrecy and control all aspects of Computer Science House. The more you 
think you know, the less you really know. What you know is what they want 
you to know and is merely a diversion from the truth. 

You may believe that the Illuminati have no power over you, but the truth is 
that every day you are being manipulated. Your "choices" to try and stop 
their underlying control are choices which they have caused to happen, because
they know what you will do in reaction to their manipulations. No matter what
you attempt, you will always be following perfectly into their plans for a 
New CSH Order. 

The committee organizes a ton of social events. Your belief that the purpose of
these events is for fun is misguided. Your enjoyment of these events is simply
a way to keep the masses under control and appeased. Take for example the weekly
movie nights. These files give subliminal messages which will be carried out by
CSH members at a time in the future which is choosen by the Illuminati. You
do not know what these instructions are and you will not know when you are
carrying them out. To you, these actions appear to be your own, made completely
consciously. the reality is that you know nothing. 

The harder you try to know more, the further from the true you are. We all have a 
place in the New CSH Order. No one knows their place, but you have no choice 
but to play along. All along you have been misguided to target your protests 
against us. But consider, would the Illuminati allow the identity of those 
truly controlling everything become know to anyone? You are simply ignorant of
the fact that you really know nothing.

\hypertarget{thirdnews}{\heading{Returning Upperclassmen}{6pt}}
There are several upperclassmen that were on co-op during the fall semester
that are now back at RIT. Freshmen should totally get to meet all these
amazing people: \\
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Will Ziener-Dignazio (slackwill)}: 5th year Computer Science major \\
	Will is coming back from co-oping at Apple where he worked on the iCloud team 
	doing really cool stuff, involving \censor{big data} and \censor{monitoring 
	your porn}. He left the Apple cult to come back to the CSH cult. Ask him
	how fibers + Java can solve all your problems. He is also an RTP so you
	can ask him to fix all your problems.
\\
\item \textbf{Derek Gonyeo (dgonyeo)}: 4th year Computer Science major \\
	Derek just finished up back-to-back co-ops at Cloudflare and CoreOS. He
	helped build a Go client for Apache HBase at Cloudflare, all open source.
	He worked on rkt while at CoreOS. It is a CLI for running app containers 
	on Linux. Ask him how containers are the hot new thing. While he really
	loves Haskell, he has been doing Go at most of his previous co-ops. Derek
	is also an RTP so make sure to pester him about everything.
\\
\item \textbf{Susan Lunn (slunn)}: 3rd year Computer Science major \\
	She just got back from San Fran where she worked at Linkedin, and Delphix.
	At Linkedin she worked on log digestion to make them easily searchable. At
	Delphix she worked on automating the build servers, which involved a lot 
	of OmniOS. When she is not nerding out over openzfs, she is powerlifting,
 	get on her level!!
\\
\item \textbf{Eric Knapik (eric11mk)}: 3rd year Computer Science major \\
	Eric has been working at CSH-founded Exablox. He worked on building a 
	copyright notice system for source code using nondeterministic finite 
	automatas and probabilistic natural language algorithms, all done in Go. 
	Eric also has gotten into bouldering while out in California. 
\\
\item \textbf{Aidan McInerny (aidan)}: 3rd year Game Design and Development major \\
	Aidan just finished up two amazing co-ops. This summer he was
	at Microsoft working on enhancing home video experience involving C++. 
	This fall semester he was at Amazon developing a platform independent 
	Mapping-Navigation engine in C++., LEGIT!!
\\
\item \textbf{Tal Cohen (tcohen)} 4th year Computer Science major and Game Design and Development minor \\
	He has spent the last 6 months at Amazon working as a SDE intern. Tal worked
	on internal tools to work with Amazon's internal codebase. He was the 
	evaluations director for the two previous years, wow that is some major 
	commitment. Give this man a round of applause!!
\\
\item \textbf{Joe Gambino (gambino)} 4th year Computer Engineer major \\
	4th year Computer Engineering major who	has spent the last 6 months
	working at Apple working on cool new hardware.
\\
\item \textbf{Michael Moffitt (moffitt)} 5th year Computer Engineering Technology major \\
    Moffitt is really interested in older technology, get him talking about 
    his love of neo-geo games. He is the one who built the awsome arcade 
    cabinet that we have in the library.
\\
\item \textbf{Michael Swan (swan)} 4th year Computer Science major \\
    Michael is coming back after working and Johnson \& Johnson, on the same
    team that Travis works on.
\\
\item \textbf{Andrew Jeddeloh (ajeddeloh)} 3rd year Computer Science major \\
    Andrew, also for some weird reason called Jello, just finished up working
    at Intuit for the last 6 months. While he is a computer science major,
    he has a love for hardware and low level stuff as well.
\\
\item \textbf{Nick Hilton (hilton)} 4th year Computer Science major \\
    Nick worked at Microsoft this past summer, where he developed a Universal
    Windows App. This past fall he was studing in Ireland as part of a foreign exchange 
    program becuase to quote him "\#FuckRIT"
\\
