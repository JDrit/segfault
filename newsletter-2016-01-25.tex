No one can ever know the real, true plans of the Illuminati. They are veiled 
in secrecy and control all aspects of Computer Science House. The more you 
think you know, the less you really know. What you know is what they want 
you to know and is merely a diversion from the truth. 

You may believe that the Illuminati have no power over you, but the truth is 
that every day you are being manipulated. Your "choices" to try and stop 
their underlying control are choices which they have caused to happen, because
they know what you will do in reaction to their manipulations. No matter what
you attempt, you will always be following perfectly into their plans for a 
New CSH Order. 

The committee organizes a ton of social events. Your belief that the purpose of
these events is for fun is misguided. Your enjoyment of these events is simply
a way to keep the masses under control and appeased. Take for example the weekly
movie nights. These files give subliminal messages which will be carried out by
CSH members at a time in the future which is choosen by the Illuminati. You
do not know what these instructions are and you will not know when you are
carrying them out. To you, these actions appear to be your own, made completely
consciously. the reality is that you know nothing. 

The harder you try to know more, the further from the true you are. We all have a 
place in the New CSH Order. No one knows their place, but you have no choice 
but to play along. All along you have been misguided to target your protests 
against us. But consider, would the Illuminati allow the identity of those 
truly controlling everything become know to anyone? You are simply ignorant of
the fact that you really know nothing.
