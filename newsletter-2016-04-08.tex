\hypertarget{firstnews}{\heading{Donald Trump in Rochester}{5pt}}

For over a year, Donald Trump has been traveling the country convincing Americans that he will be the correct choice in the 2016 elections. Interestingly enough, his numbers have been fairly consistent since the beginning of the Primary process. An example:

In February, Trump one 35\% of the votes in New Hampshire. This number was large enough for him to get a deciding victory in the state.

On Tuesday though, when 37\% of voters picked Trump, he was completely obliterated by Ted Cruz. 

Why is it that Donald Trump has been able to maintain a near 40\% of the field but has slowly been losing more and more states? The answer is that there are less candidates in the Primaries today, so that 60\% that will not vote for Trump has united under Ted Cruz or John Kasich. 

This is certainly going to be an important time in American history, and being an active participant in that process is very important. Luckily, this Sunday, Donald Trump will be coming to Rochester and be speaking to thousands of people. If you're interested in seeing him speak, as a supporter or as a dissenter, contact JD or Hudson for more information.
