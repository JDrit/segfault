\hypertarget{firstnews}{\heading{Welcome New Members}{6pt}}

Now that the introduction process has finished, I would like to welcome
all new members of Computer Science House! Congratulations are in
order. Now remember that while you have passed the introductory process,
you still still need to fulfill the expectations of house members, 
as defined in the By-Laws Section 4.D:

\begin{enumerate}
\item{\textbf{House Meetings}}: Members are required to attend all
house meetings. Please make sure that you let the Evaluations director
know if you missed one. \\

\item{\textbf{Director Meetings}}: Attend at least 25 of the permanent
director meetings. The 10 meetings you attended for the introductory 
process count towards the required 25. You should though go to more 
than 25 to stay involved with floor. \\

\item{\textbf{Major Project}}: All members are required to pass at least one
major project each year. If you are curious about what to do, talk to an
upperclassmen about what they have done in the past or an E-Board member
about what they expect for a major project. \\

\item{\textbf{Participate in House Activities}}: Make sure that you stay
involved with CSH. There are a ton of fun activities and interesting 
topics to learn.

\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{thirdnews}{\heading{Constitution Tidbits: Housing Signup 
for Next Year}{6pt}} 

We use a semi-seniority based system to determine who gets to live 
where when we do room selection for the next year. Each member has a
certain amount of Housing Points which determines the priority that
they get in selecting their room. These points are are assigned annually
according section 4.C.1 in the by-laws. Once you have found out who 
you will be living with next year, add up your two points to get the
amount of points your roommate pair have. You get an additional half
point if you stay in your current room, but that does not stack. \\
\\
Later this semester, the Evaluations director will put up a board for members to sign up on and will stay up for a preset amount of time. You are allowed to kick anyone from a room if you have \textbf{more} points than the current roommate pair that currently resides in it. It is polite though to quickly notify the people you kick. More information on this
to come.
