\hypertarget{firstnews}{\heading{CSH: We are not a cult}{6pt}}

First of all I want to disperse any rumors or thoughts that CSH is itself a
cult. Those rumors are unfounded and no where near the truth. CSH meets none of
the standard requirements for cults. Below I will go through each requirement 
for being a cult and prove to you that none of them are true about CSH. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Insistent with bringing in new members} \\ 
First of all this is so not true. We totally do not dedicate an extreme 
amount of time recruiting new members with open houses and insights.

\item \textbf{Mind-numbing techniques such as chanting} \\
All I have to say is "Social good, technical bad."

\item \textbf{Are elitist, claiming a special status for itself} \\
We CSHers don't think we are better than the rest of Golisano, we
know it.

\item \textbf{Polarized us-versus-them mentality} \\
Housing + ResLife are out to get us, I swear!!

\item \textbf{Members' subservience causes them to cut ties with friends} \\
Wait you have friends outside of CSH? How do you have time for all that goes on.
Probably will not pass Spring Evals!

\item \textbf{Expected to devote inordinate amounts of time to the group} \\
No, we only require that you do major projects, attend ALL house meetings,
go to committee meetings, and be at all major house activities like fall camping
and Secret Santa. Nothing \textit{that} time consuming.

\item \textbf{Encouraged to live and/or socialize only with other members} \\
Well, we are better than the rest of campus so why would you want to talk to
them anyways? Also, keep an eye out for randos who appear on-floor. 

\item \textbf{Removal of Privacy} \\
The RTPs totally do not monitor all network traffic. That's crazy talk. 

\item \textbf{Verbal Abuse: Desensitization through foul and abusive language} \\
Fuck JD!

\item \textbf{Change of Diet: depriving the nervous system of necessary 
nutrients} \\
Hey no one \textit{requires} you to eat garbage plates, we will just think less
of you if you don't.


\end{enumerate}

If you are still not convinced, please let the nearest E-Board member know so
that they can \textit{rectify} the situation.

\hypertarget{secondnews}{\heading{Scala, what is it?}{6pt}} 

Scala is a new-age programming language that is trying to combine features
from many other languages. The hallmarks of the language include:

\textbf{Object-Oriented}: every value is an object.

\textbf{Functional}: every function is a value. It allows for higher-order
	functions, function currying, and pattern matching. Functional design was one
	of the initial goals of the language.
	
\textbf{Statically Typed}: it is statically typed, which allows for many
	complex type features, such as type variance, upper and lower bounds, 
	compound types, implicit parameters, and polymorphic parameters.

\textbf{100\% inter-op with Java}: runs on the JVM and can use any
	Java library.

\textbf{Type Inference}: type of values do not have to be written down, the
	compiler can pick up on them for you. Allows for much cleaner and 
	concise code.
